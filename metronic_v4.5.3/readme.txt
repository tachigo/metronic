IMPORTANT:
The frontend theme includes all the demo images/photos in the purchased theme folder just for your reference. 
For the demo purposes we used some images purchased from http://photodune.net/.
However if you like to use these photodune images(listed in "resources/frontend/corporate/photos" and "resources/frontend/ecommerce/photos" folders) then you will 
need to purchase a license for each used image. Metronic does not transfer any licenses for the images from photodune. Any image which is not listed in "resources/frontend/corporate/photos" and "resources/frontend/ecommerce/photos" folders can be used for free since they are open sources images. 

NOTE: 
To use our theme support you must be a valid customer who has the valid purchase license from ThemeForest(http://themeforest.net/item/metronic-responsive-admin-dashboard-template/4021469?ref=keenthemes) 

IMPORTANT:
A single license can be used only for one domain or client. Each use of the theme requires a separate license. We hope you will follow the rules as it will help us to continue supporting our themes and providing a free future updates.
